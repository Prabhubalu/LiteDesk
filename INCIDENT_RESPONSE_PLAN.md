## 🔄 Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Identification

#### Detection Sources
- Security event logs
- Failed authentication alerts
- Rate limit violations
- Permission denial logs
- Suspicious activity alerts
- User reports
- External security advisories

#### Identification Steps
1. **Verify the incident**
   - Is this a real security issue?
   - What is the scope?
   - What systems are affected?

2. **Document initial findings**
   - Timestamp
   - Source of detection
   - Affected systems/users
   - Initial assessment

3. **Classify severity**
   - Use severity matrix above
   - Assign priority

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Isolate affected systems**
   ```bash
   # Example: Block IP address
   # Add to firewall rules
   ```

2. **Disable compromised accounts**
   ```javascript
   // Update user status to 'suspended'
   await User.updateOne(
       { _id: compromisedUserId },
       { status: 'suspended' }
   );
   ```

3. **Revoke compromised tokens**
   - Invalidate JWT tokens
   - Force password reset
   - Require re-authentication

4. **Preserve evidence**
   - Save logs
   - Take snapshots
   - Document state

#### Short-term Containment
- Block malicious IPs
- Disable affected features
- Increase monitoring
- Notify affected users

#### Long-term Containment
- Apply security patches
- Update security controls
- Review access permissions
- Implement additional safeguards

### Phase 3: Eradication

1. **Remove threat**
   - Remove malicious code
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies
   - Fix misconfigurations

2. **Verify removal**
   - Security scans
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review

3. **Document fixes**
   - What was fixed
   - How it was fixed
   - Prevention measures

### Phase 4: Recovery

1. **Restore services**
   - Verify systems are clean
   - Restore from backups if needed
   - Re-enable features gradually

2. **Monitor closely**
   - Watch for recurrence
   - Monitor logs
   - Check for anomalies

3. **Communicate**
   - Internal notification
   - User notification (if required)
   - Status updates

### Phase 5: Post-Incident

1. **Documentation**
   - Incident report
   - Timeline of events
   - Actions taken
   - Lessons learned

2. **Review**
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Process improvements

3. **Prevention**
   - Update security controls
   - Improve monitoring
   - Training and awareness
   - Update this plan
