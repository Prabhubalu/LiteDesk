## 🗑️ Optional: Delete Archives

If you don't need the historical files, you can delete them:

```bash
# Delete archived documentation
rm -rf docs/archive/

# Delete archived scripts
rm -rf scripts/archive/

# This will permanently delete 76 archived files
```

**Note:** Only do this if you're sure you won't need the historical context!
