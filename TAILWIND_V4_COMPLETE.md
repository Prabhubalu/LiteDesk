## 🎨 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Remove `@apply` Completely

**Problem:**  
Custom colors defined in `@theme` were not accessible in scoped `@apply` directives.

**Solution:**  
Converted all scoped CSS to plain CSS with hardcoded color values and `:global(.dark)` selectors.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No dependency on Tailwind's `@apply` behavior
- ✅ Full control over styling
- ✅ Better performance (no runtime processing)
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Decision 2: Use Plain CSS for Dark Mode

**Pattern:**
```css
/* Light mode (default) */
.my-class {
  background-color: #f3f4f6;
  color: #111827;
}

/* Dark mode */
:global(.dark) .my-class {
  background-color: #1f2937;
  color: #f9fafb;
}
```

**Why:**
- Works perfectly with Vue's scoped CSS
- No need for complex Tailwind directives
- Compatible with existing dark mode toggle

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Custom colors with @apply:** Custom `@theme` colors are not available in scoped `@apply` directives
2. **Plain CSS is better:** For component-specific styling, plain CSS is simpler and more reliable than `@apply`
3. **Dark mode patterns:** `:global(.dark)` selector works perfectly with Vue scoped CSS
4. **Migration strategy:** Convert incrementally, test frequently, document everything
