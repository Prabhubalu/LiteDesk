# Event Detail Route Fix

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue:** Event clicks from RelatedEventsWidget not showing event data

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

When clicking on an event from the RelatedEventsWidget (in ContactDetail or DealDetail pages), a tab was created but the event detail page was not showing.

**Symptoms:**
- ❌ Event tab created in TabBar
- ❌ Content area remained blank or showed 404
- ❌ Event detail view not rendered

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Route Mismatch:** The code was navigating to the wrong route path.

- **Router Definition:** `/events/:id` (line 82 in router/index.js)
- **Our Code Was Using:** `/calendar/events/:id` ❌

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG PATH
openTab(`/calendar/events/${eventId}`, {
  title: 'Event Detail',
  icon: '📅'
});
```

Vue Router couldn't match the route, so it didn't render the EventDetail component.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Route Paths

Updated both ContactDetail.vue and DealDetail.vue to use the correct route path:

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const viewEvent = (eventId) => {
  openTab(`/calendar/events/${eventId}`, {  // ❌ Wrong path
    title: 'Event Detail',
    icon: '📅'
  });
};
```

**After (Working):**
```javascript
const viewEvent = (eventId) => {
  openTab(`/events/${eventId}`, {  // ✅ Correct path
    title: 'Event Detail',
    icon: '📅'
  });
};
```

### 2. Added Event Icon Mapping

Updated `useTabs.js` to explicitly map `/events` to the calendar icon:

```javascript
const getIconForPath = (path) => {
  const icons = {
    '/dashboard': '🏠',
    '/contacts': '👥',
    '/organizations': '🏢',
    '/deals': '💼',
    '/tasks': '✅',
    '/calendar': '📅',
    '/events': '📅',      // ✅ Added this line
    '/imports': '⬇️',
    '/items': '📁',
    '/demo-requests': '📚',
    '/instances': '🖥️'
  };
  
  const basePath = '/' + path.split('/')[1];
  return icons[basePath] || icons[path] || '📄';
};
```

## 📝 Files Changed

### 1. `/client/src/views/ContactDetail.vue`
```javascript
// Line ~560
const viewEvent = (eventId) => {
  openTab(`/events/${eventId}`, {  // Changed from /calendar/events/
    title: 'Event Detail',
    icon: '📅'
  });
};
```

### 2. `/client/src/views/DealDetail.vue`
```javascript
// Line ~495
const viewEvent = (eventId) => {
  openTab(`/events/${eventId}`, {  // Changed from /calendar/events/
    title: 'Event Detail',
    icon: '📅'
  });
};
```

### 3. `/client/src/composables/useTabs.js`
```javascript
// Line ~67-79
const icons = {
  // ... other icons
  '/events': '📅',  // Added explicit mapping
  // ... other icons
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test Event Navigation from Contact Detail:
1. Open any contact detail page
2. Scroll to "Related Events" widget
3. Click on any event in the list
4. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Tab created with "Event Detail" title
   - ✅ Event detail page displays with full event information
   - ✅ Shows event title, date, time, location, attendees, etc.

### Test Event Navigation from Deal Detail:
1. Open any deal detail page
2. Scroll to "Related Events" widget
3. Click on any event in the list
4. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Tab created with "Event Detail" title
   - ✅ Event detail page displays correctly

### Test Direct Navigation:
1. Go to **Calendar** page (`/calendar`)
2. Click on any event
3. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Event detail opens in a new tab
   - ✅ Content displays correctly

---

## 📊 Console Output

### When clicking an event, you should see:
```
🔵 openTab called: /events/123abc current route: /contacts/456def
✨ Creating new tab: tab_1730000001 Event Detail
✅ openTab complete, activeTabId: tab_1730000001
```

### You should NOT see:
```
❌ Failed to resolve component
❌ 404 Not Found
❌ No routes matched location "/calendar/events/123"
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Flow:
1. **User clicks event** in RelatedEventsWidget
2. **Widget emits** `'view-event'` with `eventId`
3. **Parent component** (ContactDetail/DealDetail) calls `viewEvent(eventId)`
4. **`viewEvent` calls** `openTab('/events/123abc', options)`
5. **Router matches** `/events/:id` route (line 82 in router)
6. **EventDetail.vue renders** with the event data
7. **Tab displays** event information

---

## 📚 Route Configuration Reference

From `/client/src/router/index.js`:

```javascript
{
  path: '/events/:id',           // ✅ The correct path
  name: 'event-detail',
  component: () => import('@/views/EventDetail.vue'),
  meta: { 
    requiresAuth: true, 
    requiresPermission: { module: 'events', action: 'view' } 
  }
},
{
  path: '/calendar',             // Different route (list view)
  name: 'calendar',
  component: () => import('@/views/Calendar.vue'),
  meta: { 
    requiresAuth: true, 
    requiresPermission: { module: 'events', action: 'view' } 
  }
}
```

**Note:** `/calendar` is for the calendar list/grid view, `/events/:id` is for individual event details.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Test these scenarios:
- [ ] Click event from Contact detail → Opens event detail page
- [ ] Click event from Deal detail → Opens event detail page
- [ ] Event detail shows all information (title, date, time, etc.)
- [ ] Event tab has correct icon (📅)
- [ ] Can edit event from detail page
- [ ] Can add notes to event
- [ ] Can delete event from detail page
- [ ] Back button navigates correctly
- [ ] Multiple event tabs can be open simultaneously
- [ ] Switching between event tabs works correctly

---

## 🎉 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Now Working:
1. Click event from RelatedEventsWidget
2. Tab created: "📅 Event Detail"
3. Content area shows full event detail page:
   - Event title and status
   - Start/end date and time
   - Duration calculation
   - Location (if any)
   - Meeting URL (if any)
   - Attendees list
   - Related records
   - Notes and activity
4. All actions work (edit, delete, add notes)

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**Always verify route paths match the router configuration!**

When navigating programmatically, ensure the path you're using in `router.push()` or `openTab()` exactly matches a route defined in your router configuration.

**Status:** Ready for testing 🎉

Click on events from the related widgets and verify the event detail page displays correctly!
