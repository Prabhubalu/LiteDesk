# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Multi-Tenancy & RBAC

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Branch:** JWT

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

Phase 1 focused on building the foundation for a multi-tenant SaaS CRM with role-based access control and trial subscription management. All objectives have been successfully completed.

---

## ✅ Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Models

#### **Organization Model** (`/server/models/Organization.js`)
- Multi-tenant organization/workspace model
- Subscription management (trial, starter, professional, enterprise)
- 15-day trial system with automatic expiration calculation
- Feature gating based on subscription tier
- Usage limits configuration
- Helper methods:
  - `isTrialExpired()` - Check if trial has ended
  - `getTrialDaysRemaining()` - Calculate days left in trial
  - `hasFeature(featureName)` - Check if feature is enabled
  - `updateLimitsForTier(tier)` - Update limits based on subscription
  - `getModulesForTier(tier)` - Get enabled modules for tier

**Subscription Tiers:**
| Tier | Users | Contacts | Deals | Storage | Price |
|------|-------|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| Trial (15 days) | 3 | 100 | 50 | 1 GB | Free |
| Starter | 5 | 1,000 | 500 | 10 GB | $29/mo |
| Professional | 25 | 10,000 | 5,000 | 100 GB | $99/mo |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | 1 TB | Custom |

#### **Enhanced User Model** (`/server/models/User.js`)
- Organization reference for multi-tenancy
- Role-based permissions (owner, admin, manager, user, viewer)
- Granular permission structure per module
- Profile fields (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, avatar)
- Status management (active, inactive, suspended)
- Helper methods:
  - `setPermissionsByRole(role)` - Set default permissions
  - `hasPermission(module, action)` - Check specific permission
  - `getFullName()` - Get formatted name

**Role Hierarchy:**
```
Owner > Admin > Manager > User > Viewer
```

**Permission Modules:**
- Contacts (view, create, edit, delete, viewAll, exportData)
- Deals (view, create, edit, delete, viewAll, exportData)
- Projects (view, create, edit, delete, viewAll)
- Tasks (view, create, edit, delete, viewAll)
- Settings (manageUsers, manageBilling, manageIntegrations, customizeFields)
- Reports (viewStandard, viewCustom, createCustom, exportReports)

#### **Updated Contact Model** (`/server/models/Contact.js`)
- Added `organizationId` for multi-tenancy
- Compound indexes for organization + email (unique within org)
- Additional indexes for common queries

### 2. Middleware

#### **Organization Isolation** (`/server/middleware/organizationMiddleware.js`)
- `organizationIsolation` - Ensures users only access their organization's data
- `checkTrialStatus` - Blocks access if trial expired
- `checkFeatureAccess(feature)` - Verifies feature is enabled for subscription tier
- `checkLimit(limitType)` - Validates usage limits

#### **Permission Checking** (`/server/middleware/permissionMiddleware.js`)
- `checkPermission(module, action)` - Validates user permissions
- `requireRole(role)` - Enforces minimum role requirement
- `requireAdmin()` - Shorthand for admin+ access
- `requireOwner()` - Owner-only access
- `canManageUsers()` - User management permission
- `canManageBilling()` - Billing management permission
- `filterByOwnership(module)` - Filters data based on viewAll permission

### 3. Controllers

#### **Updated Auth Controller** (`/server/controllers/authController.js`)
**Registration:**
- Creates Organization on signup
- Creates Owner user with full permissions
- Sets up 15-day trial
- Returns organization data with token

**Login:**
- Populates organization data
- Checks user and organization status
- Updates last login timestamp
- Returns user + organization + permissions

#### **User Management** (`/server/controllers/userController.js`)
- `getUsers()` - List all users in organization
- `getUser(id)` - Get single user
- `inviteUser()` - Create new user with role
- `updateUser(id)` - Update role and permissions
- `deleteUser(id)` - Deactivate user (soft delete)
- `getProfile()` - Get current user profile
- `updateProfile()` - Update current user
- `changePassword()` - Change password

#### **Organization Management** (`/server/controllers/organizationController.js`)
- `getOrganization()` - Get organization details with trial info
- `updateOrganization()` - Update organization settings
- `getSubscription()` - Get subscription details and usage stats
- `upgradeSubscription(tier)` - Upgrade to paid plan
- `cancelSubscription()` - Cancel subscription
- `getStats()` - Get organization statistics

#### **Updated Contact Controller** (`/server/controllers/contactController.js`)
- All CRUD operations now include organization isolation
- Pagination support (page, limit)
- Advanced filtering (lifecycle_stage, status, lead_source)
- Search functionality (firstName, lastName, email, jobTitle)
- Respects viewAll permission (users without viewAll only see their contacts)
- Population of owner and account references

### 4. Routes

#### **User Routes** (`/server/routes/userRoutes.js`)
```
GET    /api/users/profile          # Get current user profile
PUT    /api/users/profile          # Update profile

DELETE /api/users/:id              # Deactivate user (requires manageUsers)
```

#### **Organization Routes** (`/server/routes/organizationRoutes.js`)
```
GET    /api/organization                  # Get organization

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Email Uniqueness**: Scoped to organization, not global
2. **User Deletion**: Soft delete (status = inactive)
3. **Trial Duration**: 15 days (configurable in Organization model)
4. **Owner Protection**: Cannot be deleted or modified
5. **Default Role**: New users get 'user' role by default
6. **Token Storage**: Separate user and organization in localStorage
7. **Permission Storage**: Full permission object in user model
8. **Trial Enforcement**: Middleware blocks access on expiry
9. **Feature Check**: Middleware validates module access
