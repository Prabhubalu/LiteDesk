2. ✅ **Cost:** 10-50x cheaper at scale
3. ✅ **Reliability:** Enterprise-grade (used by Netflix, Airbnb)
4. ✅ **Scalable:** Handles any volume
5. ✅ **AWS ecosystem:** Easier if you deploy on EC2/ECS later

## 🚀 Migration Path (If You Change Your Mind Later)

Good news: **Easy to switch!**

All these services use standard SMTP or have similar APIs. If you:
1. Build your email service as an abstraction layer
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Keep templates in your database

Then switching services later is just:
- Change `.env` credentials
- Update email service connection
- Test and deploy

**Estimated migration time:** 2-4 hours

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use Gmail SMTP for my CRM?**  
A: Not recommended. Gmail has daily limits (100-500/day) and isn't designed for applications.

**Q: Do I need a custom domain?**  
A: For production, yes. Emails from verified domains have better deliverability.

**Q: What about receiving emails?**  
A: AWS SES can receive too! But for helpdesk/support, consider tools like Zendesk or Help Scout.

**Q: Can I track email opens?**  
A: Yes, with tracking pixels. SES doesn't have built-in tracking, but you can implement it yourself.

**Q: What if I get my AWS account suspended?**  
A: Rare, but keep a backup service ready. Monitor bounce/complaint rates.
