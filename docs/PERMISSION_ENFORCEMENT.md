# Permission Enforcement System - Implemented

## 🔒 Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Users could see and access all modules regardless of their role permissions. A Manager with only "Contacts & Organizations" permissions could still access Deals, Tasks, Calendar, Imports, etc.

**Root Cause**: The frontend navigation and routes were not checking user permissions. They only checked for authentication, not authorization.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Navigation Filtering (Nav.vue)**

The navigation menu now **dynamically filters** based on user permissions:

```javascript
// OLD (broken):
const navigation = [
  { name: 'Contacts', href: '/contacts' },
  { name: 'Deals', href: '/deals' },
  { name: 'Tasks', href: '/tasks' },
  // ... all modules shown to everyone
];

// NEW (fixed):
const navigation = computed(() => {
  const nav = [];
  
  // Only show if user has permission
  if (authStore.can('contacts', 'view')) {
    nav.push({ name: 'Contacts', href: '/contacts' });
  }
  
  if (authStore.can('deals', 'view')) {
    nav.push({ name: 'Deals', href: '/deals' });
  }
  
  // ... conditional for each module
  return nav;
});
```

---

### **2. Route Guards (router/index.js)**

Added **permission checks** to all routes to prevent direct URL access:

```javascript
// Route Definition with Permission Requirement
{
  path: '/contacts',
  name: 'contacts',
  component: () => import('@/views/Contacts.vue'),
  meta: { 
    requiresAuth: true,
    requiresPermission: { module: 'contacts', action: 'view' }
  }
}

// Navigation Guard with Permission Check
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  // Check permissions if required
  if (to.meta.requiresPermission) {
    const { module, action } = to.meta.requiresPermission;
    const hasPermission = authStore.can(module, action);
    
    if (!hasPermission) {
      alert(`You don't have permission to access ${module}.`);
      next({ name: 'dashboard' });
      return;
    }
  }
  
  next();
});
```

## 🎯 Module-Permission Mapping

| Module | Permission Required | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Dashboard | None | Always accessible |
| Contacts | `contacts.view` | Required |
| Organizations | `contacts.view` + Admin/Owner | Subset of contacts |
| Deals | `deals.view` | Required |
| Tasks | `tasks.view` | Required |
| Calendar/Events | `tasks.view` | Uses task permissions |
| Imports | `imports.view` | Required |
| Projects | `projects.view` | Required |
| Demo Requests | Admin/Owner only | Not permission-based |
| Instances | Admin/Owner only | Not permission-based |
| Settings | None | All users, tabs filtered |

## 🧪 How It Works

### **For a Manager with Only Contacts & Organizations:**

#### **Navigation Menu Shows:**
```
✅ Dashboard
✅ Contacts
✅ Organizations
❌ Deals (hidden)
❌ Tasks (hidden)
❌ Calendar (hidden)
❌ Imports (hidden)
❌ Projects (hidden)
```

#### **Direct URL Access:**
```bash
# Allowed:
/dashboard          → ✅ Allowed
/contacts           → ✅ Allowed
/contacts/123       → ✅ Allowed
/organizations      → ✅ Allowed

# Blocked:
/deals              → ❌ Redirected to dashboard + alert
/tasks              → ❌ Redirected to dashboard + alert
/calendar           → ❌ Redirected to dashboard + alert
/imports            → ❌ Redirected to dashboard + alert
```

#### **Console Logs:**
```javascript
Navigation guard: {
  to: "/deals",
  isAuthenticated: true,
  user: { role: "manager", permissions: {...} }
}

Permission check: {
  module: "deals",
  action: "view",
  hasPermission: false,
  isOwner: false
}

Blocked: Insufficient permissions
```

## 🔐 Permission Check Methods

### **In Components:**

```javascript
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth';

const authStore = useAuthStore();

// Check if user can view a module
if (authStore.can('contacts', 'view')) {
  // Show contacts section
}

// Check if user can create
if (authStore.can('deals', 'create')) {
  // Show create button
}

// Check if user can edit
if (authStore.can('tasks', 'edit')) {
  // Enable edit functionality
}

// Check if user can delete
if (authStore.can('contacts', 'delete')) {
  // Show delete button
}
```

### **In Templates:**

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Show only if user can view contacts -->
  <div v-if="authStore.can('contacts', 'view')">
    <ContactList />
  </div>
  
  <!-- Show only if user can create deals -->
  <button 
    v-if="authStore.can('deals', 'create')"
    @click="createDeal"
  >
    Create Deal
  </button>
  
  <!-- Show only if user can delete -->
  <button 
    v-if="authStore.can('tasks', 'delete')"
    @click="deleteTask"
  >
    Delete
  </button>
</template>
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Test 1: Manager Role Permissions**

1. **Create a Manager user** with only Contacts & Organizations permissions
2. **Log in as Manager**
3. **Check Navigation:**
   - ✅ Should see: Dashboard, Contacts, Organizations
   - ❌ Should NOT see: Deals, Tasks, Calendar, Imports

4. **Try Direct URL Access:**
   ```bash
   # Type in browser:
   /deals
   ```
   - ✅ Should be redirected to dashboard
   - ✅ Should see alert: "You don't have permission to access deals"

5. **Check Console:**
   ```javascript
   Navigation guard: { to: "/deals", ... }
   Permission check: { module: "deals", action: "view", hasPermission: false }
   Blocked: Insufficient permissions
   ```

---

### **Test 2: User Role Permissions**

1. **Create a standard User**
2. **Log in as User**
3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Can see Contacts, Deals, Tasks (if configured)
   - ❌ Cannot see admin features
   - ❌ Can only see own records (if viewAll = false)

---

### **Test 3: Custom Role**

1. **Go to Settings** → **Roles & Permissions**
2. **Create a custom role:**
   - Name: "Sales Rep"
   - Permissions: Contacts (all) + Deals (view only)
3. **Assign user to "Sales Rep" role**
4. **Log in as that user**
5. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Can see Contacts and Deals in nav
   - ❌ Cannot see Tasks, Calendar, Imports
   - ✅ Can view deals but not create/edit/delete

---

## 🔄 Permission Flow

```
User Logs In
    ↓
Backend validates credentials
    ↓
Backend fetches user with populated roleId
    ↓
Backend returns user.permissions object
    ↓
Frontend stores in authStore
    ↓
Navigation menu filters based on permissions
    ↓
User clicks a link or types URL
    ↓
Router guard checks to.meta.requiresPermission
    ↓
Calls authStore.can(module, action)
    ↓
Checks user.permissions[module][action]
    ↓
If true: Allow navigation
If false: Block + redirect + alert
```

## 🛡️ Security Layers

### **Layer 1: Navigation Hiding**
- Menu items not shown if no permission
- Reduces confusion and accidental clicks

### **Layer 2: Route Guards**
- Blocks direct URL access
- Shows alert message
- Redirects to dashboard

### **Layer 3: Backend Validation** (Already Implemented)
- API endpoints check permissions
- Double security layer
- Prevents API bypass

### **Layer 4: Component-Level Checks** (Your Responsibility)
- Hide/disable buttons based on permissions
- Example: Hide delete button if no delete permission

---

## 📝 Implementation Checklist

### **Completed:**
- ✅ Updated Nav.vue with permission checks
- ✅ Added requiresPermission to all routes
- ✅ Enhanced router guard with permission validation
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging
- ✅ Preserved existing auth check
- ✅ Settings page accessible to all (tabs filtered internally)

### **To Verify:**
- [ ] Log in as Manager with limited permissions
- [ ] Confirm only permitted modules show in nav
- [ ] Try accessing restricted URL directly
- [ ] Confirm redirect and alert work
- [ ] Check console logs for permission checks

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### **If permissions are not working:**

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```javascript
   // Look for:
   Navigation guard: {...}
   Permission check: {...}
   ```

2. **Verify User Permissions:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(JSON.stringify(localStorage.getItem('user'), null, 2));
   
   // Should show:
   {
     "permissions": {
       "contacts": { "view": true, "create": true, ... },
       "deals": { "view": false, ... }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check Role Configuration:**
   - Go to Settings → Roles & Permissions
   - Click on the role
   - Verify permissions matrix

4. **Test Permission Check:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth';
   const authStore = useAuthStore();
   console.log('Can view contacts:', authStore.can('contacts', 'view'));
   console.log('Can view deals:', authStore.can('deals', 'view'));
   ```
