## üéØ Choose Your Deployment Method

### **Method 1: Super Easy - Deploy from Your Mac (RECOMMENDED)** ‚≠ê

This is the easiest way! Just run one command from your Mac.

**Step 1:** First, push your code to GitHub:
```bash
cd /Users/Prabhu/Documents/GitHub/LiteDesk
git push origin main
# (Enter your GitHub credentials if asked)
```

**Step 2:** Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy-from-local.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- Ask for your SSH key path (e.g., `~/Downloads/litedesk-key.pem`)
- Connect to your EC2 instance
- Upload the deployment script
- Run the full deployment
- Tell you when it's done!

**Time:** 5-10 minutes total

---

### **Method 2: Deploy Directly on EC2**

If you prefer to work directly on the server:

**Step 1:** Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
cd /Users/Prabhu/Documents/GitHub/LiteDesk
git push origin main
```

**Step 2:** SSH into your EC2 instance:
```bash
# Make your key file secure first
chmod 400 ~/path/to/your-key.pem

# Connect to EC2
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@43.204.144.169
```

**Step 3:** Clone and deploy:
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/Prabhubalu/LiteDesk.git
cd LiteDesk

# Run the deployment script
chmod +x deploy-aws-quick.sh
./deploy-aws-quick.sh
```

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

cd /home/ubuntu/LiteDesk
git pull
cd server && npm install && pm2 restart litedesk-api
cd ../client && npm install && npm run build
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to EC2"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if instance is running in AWS Console
# Check security group allows SSH from your IP
# Try ping:
ping 43.204.144.169
```

### Issue: "502 Bad Gateway" in browser

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@43.204.144.169

# Check if backend is running
pm2 status

# If not running, restart it
pm2 restart litedesk-api

# Check logs for errors
pm2 logs litedesk-api --lines 50
```

### Issue: "Blank page" in browser

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@43.204.144.169

# Check if frontend built successfully
ls -la /home/ubuntu/LiteDesk/client/dist

# If empty, rebuild
cd /home/ubuntu/LiteDesk/client
npm run build
```

### Issue: "Database connection error"

**Solution:**
- Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard - is cluster running?
- Check Network Access in Atlas - allows 0.0.0.0/0?
- Verify connection string in server/.env

```bash
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@43.204.144.169
cat /home/ubuntu/LiteDesk/server/.env | grep MONGODB_URI
```

4. **Setup SSL/HTTPS:**
   - Get a domain name
   - Point it to 43.204.144.169
   - Run: `sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com`

5. **Enable CloudWatch:**
   - Monitor EC2 metrics
   - Set up billing alerts

6. **Setup Backups:**
   - Enable MongoDB Atlas automated backups
   - Take EC2 snapshots weekly
