# Modal Loading Issues - Fixed

## 🐛 Issues Reported

1. **Edit User Modal** - Not loading the role value
2. **Role Users Modal** - Not loading/displaying

---

## 🔧 Root Causes & Fixes

### **Issue 1: Edit User Modal - Role Not Loading**

#### **Problem:**
When the user object is fetched from the backend, the `roleId` field is populated as an **object**, not just an ID:

```javascript
// Backend returns:
user = {
  _id: "123",
  firstName: "John",
  roleId: {
    _id: "789abc",      // ← This is the actual ID
    name: "Admin",
    color: "#ef4444"
  }
}

// But the form was trying to use:
form.roleId = user.roleId  // ❌ This is an object, not an ID!
```

#### **Solution:**
Extract the `_id` from the populated `roleId` object:

```javascript
// OLD (broken):
form.value = {
  roleId: newUser.roleId || newUser.role || '',
  status: newUser.status || 'active'
};

// NEW (fixed):
const roleIdValue = newUser.roleId?._id || newUser.roleId || newUser.role || '';
form.value = {
  roleId: roleIdValue,  // ✅ Now correctly extracts the ID
  status: newUser.status || 'active'
};
```

### **Issue 2: Role Users Modal - Not Loading**

#### **Problems:**

1. **Watch was only watching `isOpen`, not `role`**
   - If role changes while modal is open, users wouldn't refresh
   
2. **No cleanup on modal close**
   - Old user data persisted when reopening

3. **Missing error feedback**
   - No console logs to debug issues

#### **Solutions:**

##### **1. Watch Both `isOpen` and `role`**
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
watch(() => props.isOpen, async (newVal) => {
  if (newVal && props.role) {
    await fetchUsers();
  }
});

// NEW (fixed):
watch([() => props.isOpen, () => props.role], async ([newIsOpen, newRole]) => {
  if (newIsOpen && newRole?._id) {
    await fetchUsers();
  } else if (!newIsOpen) {
    users.value = [];  // Clear users when modal closes
  }
});
```

##### **2. Added Debug Logging**
```javascript
const fetchUsers = async () => {
  if (!props.role?._id) {
    console.warn('No role ID provided to fetchUsers');
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('Fetching users for role:', props.role.name, props.role._id);
  // ... fetch logic
  console.log(`Loaded ${response.data.length} users for role ${props.role.name}`);
};
```

##### **3. Fixed Edit User Modal Initialization**
```javascript
// Watch for modal opening and initialize form
watch(() => props.isOpen, (newVal) => {
  if (newVal) {
    console.log('EditUserModal opened with user:', props.user);
    fetchRoles();
    if (props.user) {
      const roleIdValue = props.user.roleId?._id || props.user.roleId || props.user.role || '';
      form.value = {
        roleId: roleIdValue,
        status: props.user.status || 'active'
      };
    }
  }
});
```

## 🐛 Debug Console Output

### **Normal Flow:**

```javascript
// 1. Open Role Users Modal
Opening users modal for role: Admin
Fetching users for role: Admin 789abc
Loaded 5 users for role Admin

// 2. Edit User
Opening edit modal for user: {firstName: "John", roleId: {_id: "789abc", name: "Admin"}}
EditUserModal opened with user: {firstName: "John", ...}
Setting form.roleId to: 789abc from user: {...}

// 3. Save
User updated successfully

// 4. Close modals
(Cleanup happens silently)
```

Setting form.roleId to: "" from user: {...}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### **Before Fix:**

```
User Object (from backend)
  ↓
  roleId: { _id: "789abc", name: "Admin" }  ← Object
  ↓
EditUserModal form
  ↓
  form.roleId = { _id: "789abc", name: "Admin" }  ❌ Wrong!
  ↓
Select dropdown
  ↓
  <option value="[object Object]">...  ❌ Doesn't match!
```

### **After Fix:**

```
User Object (from backend)
  ↓
  roleId: { _id: "789abc", name: "Admin" }
  ↓
Extract ID
  ↓
  roleIdValue = "789abc"  ← String ID
  ↓
EditUserModal form
  ↓
  form.roleId = "789abc"  ✅ Correct!
  ↓
Select dropdown
  ↓
  <option value="789abc" selected>Admin  ✅ Matches!
```
