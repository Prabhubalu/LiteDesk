## How to use this document

## World-class polish (all verticals)

Apply before customer handoff:

| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Naming** | Module labels match customer vocabulary (Settings → Module display names) |
| **Required fields** | Only require what users can consistently fill |
| **Picklists** | Curated, non-overlapping values; no free-text where picklist suffices |
| **Pipeline** | ≤8 deal stages; each stage has clear exit criteria documented |
| **Permissions** | Least privilege; test with `User` role not just `Owner` |
| **Empty states** | Primary modules show next-best-action links |
| **Notifications** | Rules don’t spam; digest for low-priority |
| **Business hours** | Match customer operations before SLAs |
| **Trash policy** | Train users on soft-delete recovery |
| **Mobile** | If field/mobile vertical, test offline on real device |
| **i18n** | If multi-language, run `npm run i18n:check` before go-live |
| **Backups** | Document export procedure (CSV + commercial PDFs) |
