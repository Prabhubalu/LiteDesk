### If Still Broken:
- ❌ Blank white page
- ❌ 404 error
- ❌ Loading spinner forever
- ❌ "Event not found" message

## 🔍 Console Checks

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

### ✅ Good (Working):
```
🔵 openTab called: /events/123abc456 current route: /contacts/789def
✨ Creating new tab: tab_1730000001 Event Detail
Navigation guard: { to: "/events/123abc456", isAuthenticated: true }
Allowed: Normal navigation
✅ openTab complete, activeTabId: tab_1730000001
```

### ❌ Bad (Broken):
```
❌ No routes matched location "/calendar/events/123"
❌ Failed to resolve component for route "/calendar/events/123"
❌ 404 Not Found
```

---

## 🚨 If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Check console** for any red errors
5. **Verify route** in browser URL bar:
   - Should be: `http://localhost:5173/events/123abc456` ✅
   - NOT: `http://localhost:5173/calendar/events/123` ❌

---

- ✅ Event title, date, time all visible
- ✅ Can scroll through event information
- ✅ Edit button works (opens modal)
- ✅ Can add notes to the event
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ URL shows `/events/123abc` (not `/calendar/events/123`)
