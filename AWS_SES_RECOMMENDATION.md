## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Do These First:

2. ✅ **Request production access** - Required to send to any email
3. ✅ **Set up DKIM/SPF** - Prevents emails going to spam
4. ✅ **Monitor bounce rate** - Keep it under 5%

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Start with sandbox mode for testing
- ✅ Validate email addresses before sending
- ✅ Use email templates for consistency
- ✅ Implement email queue for reliability
- ✅ Track bounces and remove invalid emails
- ✅ Monitor AWS SES dashboard regularly

---

## 🆚 Alternatives Considered

### Why NOT use these for your CRM:

**SendGrid:**
- ❌ 3-9x more expensive
- ❌ Overkill for transactional emails
- ⚠️ Good if you need campaign features later

**Mailgun:**
- ❌ 3-8x more expensive
- ⚠️ Good API, but costs add up

**Gmail SMTP:**
- ❌ Daily limits (100-500 emails)
- ❌ Not designed for applications
- ❌ Can get account suspended

**Postmark:**
- ❌ 5-15x more expensive
- ⚠️ Excellent service, but premium price

---

## 🔮 Future: Receiving Emails

AWS SES can also **receive emails**! 

Use cases:
- Support ticketing (emails → tickets)
- Email parsing (emails → CRM records)
- Reply tracking (link replies to conversations)

Implementation:
- Set up SES receipt rules
- Store emails in S3
- Process via Lambda or webhook
- Link to CRM records

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours  
**Cost:** Nearly free (S3 storage only)

📖 **Will create guide if you need this!**
